## Technical Contra Resources
- cdss.org Appendices

## After talking strategy with Semion
- graph paper: each h4 is 4x4 grid.
- To move people in a h4, work on diagraming starting and ending positions (maybe progression arrows too)
- moveTo functions of people, triggered through h4 object and from set object
- easier to incorporate end effects this way: ghost h4 at each end, sometimes will have 0 people, sometimes 2
  -

## For now, for this project
- work with graph paper for a little bit
- keep hard coding move objects
- have them call console.log methods to log their description. Later can update the method they call to show movement animations
