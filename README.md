# Angular Practice - A Clone of Scott Percic's Contra Design Tool Website
[Working Clone from scottpercic.com](http://scottpercic.com/contra.html)
## Rita Bennett-Chew

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.5.

## User Stories for Friday 8/17/18
  1. Upon landing on the page, a user should see three sections: Visual Display, Moves Type List, Moves Queue
  1. Upon clicking a specific type of move in the Moves List, a user should see all the moves of that type
  1. Each move in the Move Type list should have a (+) button, which will add it to the last position in the Queue
  1. Any moves in the queue will have a (-) button, which will delete them from the queue
  1. Within the queue, users will be able to move moves up or down

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
